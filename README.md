# Basic Exercises

## Exercise 1: Hello World
- Create a Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Exercise 2: Variables and Data Types
- Declare variables of different data types (int, double, String) and print their values.

## Exercise 3: Control Structures
- Write a program that uses if-else statements to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Write a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers 1 to 10.

# OOP Exercises

## Exercise 1: Classes and Objects
- Create a `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`. Create an object of the class and print the details.

## Exercise 2: Inheritance
- Create a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`. Create a subclass `Dog` that overrides the `makeSound()` method.

## Exercise 3: Encapsulation
- Create a class `BankAccount` with private attributes `accountNumber` and `balance`. Provide public methods to get and set the balance.

# Collection Exercises

## Exercise 1: Lists
- Create a list of integers and print all the elements using a for loop.

## Exercise 2: Sets
- Create a set of strings and add duplicate elements. Print the set and observe the behavior.

## Exercise 3: Maps
- Create a map with key-value pairs representing a dictionary. Add, remove, and update entries, and print the final map.
